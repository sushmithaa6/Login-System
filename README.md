# Login-System
This is a basic login page that consists of a form with two input fields for the username and password, and a submit button. The JavaScript code carries the form submission and performs validation on the entered username and password.
If the username is "sushmitha" and the password is "1234" an alert will be displayed saying "Login successful!" and the user will be redirected to a dashboard page called "success.html". Otherwise, an alert will be displayed saying "Invalid username or password. Please try again."
